# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a simple chatbot application with a clean dark mode interface, model switching capabilities, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality. The application will provide users with an intuitive chat experience while allowing them to toggle between fast and premium AI models and leverage document-based knowledge retrieval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a chatbot through a simple interface, so that I can ask questions and receive AI-generated responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a clean chat interface with dark mode styling
2. WHEN a user types a message and submits it THEN the system SHALL display the message in the chat history
3. WHEN a user submits a message THEN the system SHALL generate an AI response and display it in the chat history
4. WHEN the chat history becomes long THEN the system SHALL maintain scrollable chat history

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between fast and premium AI models, so that I can choose between speed and quality based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the interface THEN the system SHALL display a toggle switch for model selection
2. WHEN a user toggles to fast mode THEN the system SHALL use a faster, less expensive AI model for responses
3. WHEN a user toggles to premium mode THEN the system SHALL use a higher-quality, more capable AI model for responses
4. WHEN a user switches models THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which model is currently active
5. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL use the currently selected model

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to access relevant document information, so that I can get more accurate and contextual responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL search for relevant document content using vector similarity
2. WHEN relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL include this context in the AI model prompt
3. WHEN no relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL still provide a response using the AI model's base knowledge
4. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL use Langchain for document processing and retrieval
5. WHEN storing document embeddings THEN the system SHALL use Supabase with pgvector for vector storage and search

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and manage documents for the RAG system, so that the chatbot can reference my specific documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to add documents THEN the system SHALL provide a document upload interface
2. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL process it into chunks and generate embeddings
3. WHEN document processing is complete THEN the system SHALL store the embeddings in the vector database
4. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL provide feedback on processing status
5. WHEN document processing fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive dark mode interface, so that I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a dark theme by default
2. WHEN viewing the interface THEN the system SHALL use appropriate contrast and colors for readability
3. WHEN using different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain a responsive layout
4. WHEN interacting with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback
5. WHEN displaying chat messages THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between user and AI messages
