# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a ChatGPT-style conversational AI application specifically designed for pharmacology education and assistance. The application will use Langchain with Supabase pgvector for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), provide user authentication, ensure user privacy, and offer a beautiful responsive UI that works in both light and dark modes. The app will be deployed on Streamlit Cloud with two AI model tiers for different user needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pharmacology student or professional, I want to have conversations with an AI assistant about pharmacology topics, so that I can get accurate, contextual answers based on reliable pharmacology knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a pharmacology question THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant context from the knowledge base using RAG
2. WHEN the system processes a query THEN it SHALL use either Groq Gemma2-9B-IT (fast mode) or Qwen3-32B (premium mode) to generate responses
3. WHEN a response is generated THEN it SHALL be contextually relevant to pharmacology and based on retrieved knowledge
4. WHEN a user engages in conversation THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history within the session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in and sign out of the application, so that I can have a personalized and secure experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN they SHALL be presented with authentication options
2. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and grant access
3. WHEN a user clicks sign out THEN the system SHALL terminate their session and redirect to login
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL not allow access to chat functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversations to be private from other users, so that I can discuss sensitive topics without privacy concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL only display their own conversation history
2. WHEN storing messages THEN the system SHALL associate each message with the authenticated user's ID
3. WHEN retrieving conversation history THEN the system SHALL filter results by the current user's ID
4. WHEN a user signs out and another signs in THEN the new user SHALL not see the previous user's conversations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose between fast and premium AI models, so that I can balance response speed with quality based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the chat interface THEN they SHALL see options to select fast mode or premium mode
2. WHEN fast mode is selected THEN the system SHALL use Groq Gemma2-9B-IT model
3. WHEN premium mode is selected THEN the system SHALL use Qwen3-32B model
4. WHEN a model selection is made THEN the system SHALL persist this preference for the session
5. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which mode is active

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a beautiful and readable interface that works well in both light and dark modes, so that I can use the application comfortably in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN they SHALL see a modern, clean, and intuitive interface
2. WHEN a user toggles between light and dark modes THEN all UI elements SHALL adapt appropriately
3. WHEN viewing conversations THEN messages SHALL be clearly distinguishable between user and AI responses
4. WHEN using the application on different screen sizes THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and usable
5. WHEN interacting with UI elements THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use Supabase pgvector for knowledge storage and retrieval, so that we can efficiently perform semantic search on pharmacology content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL connect to Supabase with pgvector extension
2. WHEN storing knowledge documents THEN the system SHALL generate and store vector embeddings
3. WHEN processing user queries THEN the system SHALL perform semantic similarity search using pgvector
4. WHEN retrieving context THEN the system SHALL return the most relevant documents based on vector similarity
5. IF the vector database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably on Streamlit Cloud, so that I can access it from anywhere without installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL run successfully on Streamlit Cloud
2. WHEN users access the application THEN it SHALL load within reasonable time limits
3. WHEN handling multiple concurrent users THEN the system SHALL maintain performance
4. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN they SHALL be properly configured for cloud deployment
5. IF there are deployment issues THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
