else:
    st.error(result['message'])
```

response = result['response']
using_rag = result['using_rag']
```

### Health Monitoring
```python
from rag_integration_fix import show_rag_health, show_document_stats

show_rag_health()  # Shows system status
show_document_stats(user_id)  # Shows user document count
```
