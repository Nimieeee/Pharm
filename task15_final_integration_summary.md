### ‚úÖ 3. Verify user data isolation across multiple concurrent users
**Status: COMPLETED**

Implemented and tested comprehensive data isolation:

**Database Level Isolation:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure user-scoped data access
- All queries filtered by authenticated user ID
- Message storage isolated per user
- Document storage isolated per user
- Conversation history isolated per user

**Application Level Isolation:**
- SessionManager maintains user-specific state
- ChatManager enforces user-scoped operations

- PerformanceOptimizer uses user-scoped caching
- AuthGuard prevents unauthorized access

**Concurrent User Testing:**
- Multiple user sessions tested simultaneously
- Cross-user data access prevented
- User-specific caching verified
- Session isolation confirmed

### ‚úÖ 4. Validate theme switching and responsive design across devices
**Status: COMPLETED**

Comprehensive theme and responsive design validation:

**Theme Switching:**
- Light/Dark mode toggle functionality
- CSS generation for both themes
- Theme persistence across sessions
- Consistent color schemes
- Accessibility compliance (contrast ratios)

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-friendly layouts (single column)
- Tablet layouts (two columns)
- Desktop layouts (multi-column)
- Wide screen optimization
- Touch-friendly interface elements

**Cross-Device Compatibility:**
- Mobile devices (375px width)
- Tablets (768px width)
- Desktop (1024px width)
- Wide screens (1440px+ width)
- Proper CSS media queries
