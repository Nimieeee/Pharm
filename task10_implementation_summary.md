    st.success(f"Processed {result.documents_processed} documents")
else:
    st.error(result.message)
```

### RAG Query
```python
from enhanced_rag_integration import stream_query_documents

for chunk in stream_query_documents(query, user_id, model_type):
    if isinstance(chunk, str):
        st.write(chunk, end="")
    else:
        # Final result with metadata
        if chunk.using_rag:
            st.info(f"Enhanced with {chunk.documents_retrieved} documents")
```
