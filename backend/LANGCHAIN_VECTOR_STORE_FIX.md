# LangChain Vector Store Integration Fix

## Problem
The AI was appearing "ignorant" of uploaded documents because the RAG system wasn't properly using LangChain's native Supabase vector store integration. Instead, it was making manual database queries which may not have been optimized for semantic search.

## Solution
Updated `enhanced_rag.py` to properly use LangChain's `SupabaseVectorStore`:

### Key Changes

1. **Added LangChain Embeddings Wrapper**
   - Created `MistralEmbeddingsWrapper` class that implements LangChain's `Embeddings` interface
   - Wraps our existing Mistral embeddings service for compatibility

2. **Initialized SupabaseVectorStore**
   - Now using `SupabaseVectorStore` from `langchain_community.vectorstores`
   - Properly configured with Supabase client, embeddings, and table name
   - Uses the existing `match_documents_with_user_isolation` function

3. **Updated Search Method**
   - Now uses `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores()` from LangChain
   - Properly filters by conversation_id and user_id using metadata
   - Lowered default threshold from 0.7 to 0.3 for better recall
   - Automatic fallback to lower threshold (0.1) if no results found
   - Falls back to recent chunks if similarity search fails

4. **Updated Document Storage**
   - Now uses `vector_store.add_documents()` for batch insertion
   - Automatically handles embedding generation through LangChain
   - Falls back to manual storage if LangChain method fails

5. **Improved Context Retrieval**
   - Uses threshold of 0.2 for context retrieval (better recall)
   - Properly formats multi-document context with similarity scores

## Benefits

- **Better Semantic Search**: LangChain's vector store is optimized for similarity search
- **Proper Integration**: Uses industry-standard patterns instead of custom queries
- **Better Recall**: Lower thresholds (0.2-0.3) ensure documents are actually retrieved
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: Multiple fallback strategies if search fails
- **Metadata Filtering**: Proper isolation by conversation and user

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Upload a document to a conversation
2. Ask a question related to the document content
3. Check logs for: `"âœ… Found X similar chunks using LangChain"`
4. Verify the AI response references the document content

## Configuration

The system uses these settings from `config.py`:
- `MISTRAL_EMBED_DIMENSIONS`: 1024 (Mistral embed model)
- `MISTRAL_EMBED_MODEL`: "mistral-embed"
- Vector store table: `document_chunks`
- Search function: `match_documents_with_user_isolation`

## Thresholds

- **Search**: 0.3 (default), falls back to 0.1 if no results
- **Context**: 0.2 (for better recall when building context)
- **Relevance scores**: Higher is better (LangChain convention)
