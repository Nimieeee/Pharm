# UI Improvements Applied

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed Embedding Initialization Messages
**Problem:** App was showing technical messages like "✅ SentenceTransformer initialized successfully (method 1)"

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed success message from `_initialize_sentence_transformers()` in `rag.py`
- Removed OpenAI embeddings fallback message
- Embedding initialization now happens silently in the background

### 2. ✅ Moved Upload Button Above Chat Input
**Problem:** Upload button was at the top of the page, far from where users interact

**Fix Applied:**
- Moved entire document upload section to be just above the chat input box
- Better user flow: chat history → upload documents → type message
- More intuitive placement for document-enhanced conversations

## UI Flow Now

```
[Header: PharmGPT]
[Warning banner if schema not updated]

[Chat History]
  - Previous messages display here

[Document Upload Section] ← Moved here
  - Upload button
  - Processing indicators
  - Document stats
  - Management buttons (Check Isolation, Clear Documents)

[Chat Input Box] ← Right below upload
  - "Ask me anything about pharmacology..."
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Interface** - No more technical initialization messages
2. **Better UX Flow** - Upload documents right before asking questions
3. **Logical Grouping** - All interaction elements (upload + chat) are together
4. **Reduced Clutter** - Only essential messages shown to users

## Files Modified

- **`rag.py`** - Removed embedding initialization success messages
- **`simple_app.py`** - Moved upload section above chat input
- **`UI_IMPROVEMENTS.md`** - This documentation

The interface is now cleaner and more user-friendly with a logical flow from chat history to document upload to message input.
